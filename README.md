## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB data up to 2017 in Seattle to better understand:

1. Which neighborhoods in Seattle are most popular among AirBnB visitors?
2. What is the busiest time of a year to visit Seattle?
3. Which factors are most important in determining the pricing of AirBnB listings?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is `.ipynb` file available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
This notebook demonstrated step by step the process of data prepartion, data processing, modelings and visualizations.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code that does the same thing in the notebook above.
There is also a `.html` file for the notebook for displaying purpose.

AirBnB data could be downloaded at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) or it can be found at this Github repo as well.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the blog post
[here](https://randomwalk10.github.io/data%20science/2018/11/16/airbnb-seattle/).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to AirBnB for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at
the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). Also, I would like to thank Josh Bernhard for
his inspirations [here](https://github.com/jjrunner/stackoverflow). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
